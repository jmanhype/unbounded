## Current Priorities
1. Implement character personality traits system:
   - Define core personality traits (OCEAN model)
   - Add trait influence on interactions
   - Create trait development mechanics
   - Implement personality-based response generation

2. Add character relationships system:
   - Define relationship types and metrics
   - Track relationship history
   - Implement relationship influence on interactions
   - Add relationship development mechanics

3. Develop interactive storytelling system:
   - Create dynamic story generation
   - Add branching dialogue options
   - Implement story arcs and quests
   - Add narrative progression tracking

4. Implement character development system:
   - Add skill progression
   - Create achievement tracking
   - Define character growth milestones
   - Add experience and leveling mechanics

## Upcoming Features
- Advanced character personality development
- Dynamic environment generation
- Character skill progression system
- Achievement system
- User preferences and settings
- Advanced storytelling with branching narratives
- Multi-character interactions
- Dynamic world events
- Character memory system
- Emotional state modeling

## Known Issues
1. Need to optimize image generation response times
2. Improve error handling for API failures
3. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Implement request caching
5. Add comprehensive input validation

## Technical Debt
1. Improve test coverage
2. Add comprehensive API documentation
3. Implement proper configuration management
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Add database migrations
6. Enhance logging system
7. Optimize API performance and caching

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement personality traits system:
   - Create personality traits schema
   - Update character model and state
   - Add personality influence on interactions
   - Implement trait development mechanics
   - Add personality-based response generation

2. Set up proper testing:
   - Add unit tests for all components
   - Create integration tests
   - Set up test database
   - Add CI/CD pipeline
